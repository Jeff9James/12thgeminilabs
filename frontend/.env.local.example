# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and update the values

# Backend API URL
# For local development:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# For production (Vercel):
# Set this in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# Example: VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api

# IMPORTANT:
# - Do NOT include trailing slashes
# - MUST include /api at the end since the backend routes use /api prefix
# - Must be set in Vercel for production builds
# - Example correct: https://web-production-cc201.up.railway.app/api
# - Example wrong: https://web-production-cc201.up.railway.app/ (missing /api)
# - Example wrong: https://web-production-cc201.up.railway.app/api/ (trailing slash)
